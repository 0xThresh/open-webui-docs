# ⚙️ What are Tools?

Tools are small Python scripts that add superpowers to your LLM. When enabled, they allow your chatbot to do amazing things — like search the web, scrape data, generate images, talk back using AI voices, and more.

To use Tools, your chosen LLM must support "function calling". Think of Tools as useful plugins that your AI can use when chatting with you.

Here are just a few examples of what Tools let your AI assistant do:

- 🌍 Web Search: Get real-time answers by searching the internet.
- 🖼️ Image Generation: Create images from your prompts.
- 🔊 Voice Output: Generate AI voices using ElevenLabs.

# 🔧 How to Use Tools in Open WebUI

Once you've installed Tools (we’ll show you how below), here’s how to use them:

1. Go to: Workspace ➡️ Models
2. Pick the model (like GPT-4 or LLaMa2) and click the ✏️ pencil icon to edit it.
3. Scroll down to the “Tools” section.
4. ✅ Check the Tools you want to enable and click Save.

Now, open a chat and click the ➕ plus icon to use Tools with your conversation!

💡 Tip: Enabling a Tool doesn't mean it will always be used — your AI will choose when it’s helpful. You can also use something called the AutoTool Filter to let the LLM pick the right Tool automatically.

🎯 Remember: Even when using AutoTool, you still have to enable Tools from the Model Settings!
