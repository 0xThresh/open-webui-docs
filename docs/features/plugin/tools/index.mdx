# ⚙️ What are Tools?

Tools are small Python scripts that add superpowers to your LLM. When enabled, they allow your chatbot to do amazing things — like search the web, scrape data, generate images, talk back using AI voices, and more.

To use Tools, your chosen LLM must support "function calling". Think of Tools as useful plugins that your AI can use when chatting with you.

# 🔧 How to Use Tools in Open WebUI

Once you've installed Tools (we’ll show you how below), here’s how to enable and use them:

You have two ways to enable a Tool for your model:

### ✏️ Option 1: Enable by Default (Recommended for Frequent Use)
1. Go to: Workspace ➡️ Models
2. Choose the model you’re using (like GPT-4 or LLaMa2) and click the ✏️ edit icon.
3. Scroll down to the “Tools” section.
4. ✅ Check the Tools you want your model to have access to by default.
5. Click Save.

This ensures the model always has these Tools ready to use whenever you chat with it.

### ➕ Option 2: Enable from the Chat Window

While chatting, click the ➕ icon in the input area. You’ll see a list of available Tools — you can enable any of them on the fly for that session.

💡 Tip: Enabling a Tool gives the model permission to use it — but it may not use it unless it's useful for the task.

You can also let your LLM auto-select the right Tools using the AutoTool Filter:

🎯 Note: Even when using AutoTool, you still need to enable your Tools using one of the two methods above.

✅ And that’s it — your LLM is now Tool-powered! You're ready to supercharge your chats with web search, image generation, voice output, and more.
