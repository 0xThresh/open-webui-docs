## Overview

Open WebUI v0.6+ supports seamless integration with external tools via the OpenAPI servers — meaning you can easily extend your LLM workflows using custom or community-powered tool servers 🧰.

In this guide, you'll learn how to launch an OpenAPI-compatible tool server and connect it to Open WebUI through the intuitive user interface. Let’s get started! 🚀

---

## Step 1: Launch an OpenAPI Tool Server

To begin, you'll need to start one of the reference tool servers available in the openapi-servers repo. For quick testing, we’ll use the time tool server as an example.

🛠️ Example: Starting the `time` server locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-webui/openapi-servers
cd openapi-servers

# Navigate to the time server
cd servers/time

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload
```

Once running, this will host a local OpenAPI server at http://localhost:8000, which you can point Open WebUI to.

## Step 2: Connect Tool Server in Open WebUI

Next, connect your running tool server to Open WebUI:

1. Open WebUI in your browser.
2. Open ⚙️ **Settings**.
3. Click on ➕ **Tools** to add a new tool server.
4. Enter the URL where your OpenAPI tool server is running (e.g., http://localhost:8000).
5. Click "Save".

### 🧑‍💻 User Tool Servers vs. 🛠️ Global Tool Servers

There are two ways to register tool servers in Open WebUI:

#### 1. User Tool Servers (added via regular Settings)

- Only accessible to the user who registered the tool server.
- The connection is made directly from the backend (server-side) on behalf of that user.
- Perfect for personal workflows or when testing custom/local tools.

#### 2. Global Tool Servers (added via Admin Settings)

Admins can manage shared tool servers available to all or selected users across the entire deployment:

- Go to 🛠️ **Admin Settings > Tools**.
- Add the tool server URL just as you would in user settings.
- These tools are treated similarly to Open WebUI’s built-in tools.

![Global Tool Server Message Input](/images/openapi-servers/open-webui/global-message-input.png)

⚠️ Important:

- By default, global tool servers are not activated — each one must be toggled ON explicitly before becoming available.
- Once enabled, global tool servers are accessible by all users (or can be limited based on role-based access features).

This is ideal for team setups or shared environments, where commonly-used tools (e.g. document search, memory, or web lookup) should be centrally accessible by multiple users.


### 👉 Optional: Using a Config File with mcpo

If you're running multiple tools through mcpo using a config file, take note:

🧩 Each tool is mounted under its own unique path!

For example, if you’re using memory and time tools simultaneously through mcpo, they’ll each be available at a distinct route:

- http://localhost:8000/time
- http://localhost:8000/memory

This means:

- When connecting a tool in Open WebUI, you must enter the full route to that specific tool — do NOT enter just the root URL (http://localhost:8000).
- Add each tool individually in Open WebUI Settings using their respective subpath URLs.

✅ Good:

http://localhost:8000/time  
http://localhost:8000/memory

🚫 Not valid:

http://localhost:8000

This ensures Open WebUI recognizes and communicates with each tool server correctly.

---

## Step 3: Confirm Your Tool Server Is Connected ✅

Once your tool server is successfully connected, Open WebUI will display a 👇 tool server indicator directly in the message input area:

📍 You'll now see this icon below the input box:

![Tool Server Indicator](/images/openapi-servers/open-webui/message-input.png)

Clicking this icon opens a popup where you can:

- View connected tool server information
- See which tools are available and which server they're provided by
- Debug or disconnect any tool if needed

🔍 Here’s what the tool information modal looks like:

## (Optional) Step 4: Use "Native" Function Calling (ReACT-style) Tool Use 🧠

:::info
For this to work effectively, **your selected model must support native tool calling**. Some local models claim support but often produce poor results. We strongly recommend using GPT-4o or another OpenAI model that supports function calling natively for the best experience.
:::

Want to enable ReACT-style (Reasoning + Acting) native function calls directly inside your conversations? You can switch Open WebUI to use native function calling.

✳️ How to enable native function calling:

1. Open the chat window.
2. Go to ⚙️ **Chat Controls > Advanced Params**.
3. Change the **Function Calling** parameter from `Default` to `Native`.

## Need More Tools? Explore & Expand! 🧱

The openapi-servers repo includes a variety of useful reference servers:

- 📂 Filesystem access
- 🧠 Memory & knowledge graphs
- 🗃️ Git repo browsing
- 🌎 Web search (WIP)
- 🛢️ Database querying (WIP)

You can run any of these in the same way and connect them to Open WebUI by repeating the steps above.

## Troubleshooting & Tips 🧩

- ❌ Not connecting? Make sure the URL is correct and accessible from the browser used to run Open WebUI.
- 🔒 If you're using remote servers, check firewalls and HTTPS configs!
- 📝 To make servers persist, consider deploying them in Docker or with system services.
